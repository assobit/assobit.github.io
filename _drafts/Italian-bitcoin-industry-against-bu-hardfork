# Italian Association of Blockchain related technology on Bitcoin Unlimited Hardfork

** Who we are **
Our association is composed of companies and professionals 
working on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies.

** What we believe **
Our activity need a responsible roadmap of continuous improvement.

The main value proposition of Bitcoin is censorship resistance 
obtained by the best achievable amount of decentralization,
The permissionless access to the network and the absence of 
the need of a trusted third party.

** What we think **
Segeregated Witness represent for us the way forward on the 
road of continuous responsible improving,
being retro compatible, opt-in, well supported, well tested, 
bringing a lot of incremental improvements to the actual 
system and open the doors to future safer and more promising 
improvements as well.

We are strongly against contentious hard forks made with mere 
hashing power which don't take into account the economic
majority and users' needs against which there are not enough 
safeguards regarding the stability of the system and 
planned for different goals from the security of the system itself.

We consider any change to the fundamental parameters of the 
consensus system leading to an hard fork like a parassital attempt
to bootstrap a new altcoin and we ask the industry as a whole 
to act in accordance to what already stated by the main
exchanges in terms of naming and considering the new altcoin.
